<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are sites that contain the weather and news , I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. 
Here's why:
* Weather and News Sites often have unnessary info which slows the process of getting info
* News Sites with articles attatched should have a summary feature to allow users to see the summary
* The summary should be concise

The following project has the following features:
* Shows weather info (hourly and daily), searchable by zipcode or by state

* For News, the ability to search for news while also having the ability to summarize articles
